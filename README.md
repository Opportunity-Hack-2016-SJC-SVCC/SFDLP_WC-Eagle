1. What it does
    
	We deviced a web API to access the algorithm which takes set of rules into account and provides results in terms of entities which satisfies them. Additionally we have developed an application that enables administrator of system to modify existing rules, setup rules for specific groups and provides analytics to give insights on organization's performance.

2. How we built it

  We have developed a web API using nodejs and mySQL to access algorithm for ranking workers considering different set of rules and engagement of worker with organization.
 
3. Challenges we ran into

  Since we couldnot collaborate with diffrent teams and we had a dependency for the data, we had to populate the data set considering the data covers all the possible set of rules

4. Accomplishments that we're proud of

	We feel that we have addressed the problem solution efficiently. 
  We are proud that we have gone an extra mile and provided additional features like rule modification, rule association and providing analytics.

5. What we learned

  We learnt to manage time effectively.

6. What's next for SF Day Labor Program & Woman’s Collectv - Rankng System

  	We are planning to collaborate with other teams and develop a end to end solution that would be useful for the organization
